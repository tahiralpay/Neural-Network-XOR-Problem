# Neural-Network-XOR-Problem
With the book called Perceptrons, published by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert in 1969, it was argued that single-layer and feed-forward artificial neural networks cannot be a logical solution to every problem. By citing the XOR problem as an example, a discussion was started that would shelve the studies of artificial neural networks for a long time. Finally, a solution to this problem was found by creating multi-layer artificial neural networks with both forward and feedback.
In this article, we will examine the creation of a model with artificial neural networks and coding in python language (without a library) for the solution of the XOR problem.
